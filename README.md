# Virtual-On PS3 English Translation
An English translation for the PlayStation 3 release of Cyber Troopers Virtual-On (retroactively subtitled 'Operation Moongate'). This translation covers the <b><i>frontend and UI</i></b> surrounding the game. The game itself is already entirely in English.

On the <b><i>Releases</i></b> page, download <b><i>omg_english.zip</i></b>. Disregard the source code folders, they will not work.

# How to install
1: Download <b><i>HoneyPatcher</b></i> from https://github.com/coatlessali/HoneyPatcher.

2: Once installed, click <b><i>Select Game...</b></i> and select <b>Cyber Troopers Virtual-On: Operation Moongate</b></i>; the fourth option in the list.

3: Click <b><i>Select USRDIR...</i></b> and navigate to where your installation of the game's USRDIR folder is. Typically, this will be found in the folder where you have the RPCS3 emulator installed, then dev_hdd0\game\NPJB00321.

4: Click <b><i>Open mods folder...</i></b> and place the translation zip folder in there. Do not unzip the translation zip folder.

5: Click <b><i>Install all mods...</i></b>.

6: Run the game. If the notice about <b>photosensitivity</b> that appears before the game starts is in English (<i>the two prior notices are still in Japanese, disregard them</i>), then the translation has installed correctly.

# Updating the patch

If you are updating from an older version of the translation to the current version, please select <b></i>Uninstall all mods...</i></b> first <b>before</b> to restore the Virtual-On game files to an unmodified state before clicking <b><i>Install all mods...</b></i>.
