# Virtual-On PS3 English Translation
An English translation for the PlayStation 3 release of Cyber Troopers Virtual-On (retroactively subtitled 'Operation Moongate').

# How to install
1: Download <b><i>HoneyPatcher</b></i> from https://github.com/coatlessali/HoneyPatcher.

2: Once installed, click <b><i>Select Game...</b></i> and select <b>Cyber Troopers Virtual-On: Operation Moongate</b></i>; the fourth option in the list.

3: Click <b><i>Select USRDIR...</i></b> and navigate to where your installation of the game's USRDIR folder is. Typically, this will be found in the folder where you have the RPCS3 emulator installed, then dev_hdd0\game\NPJB00321.

4: Click <b><i>Open mods folder...</i></b> and place the translation zip folder in there. Do not unzip the translation zip folder.

5: Click <b><i>Install all mods...</i></b>.

6: Run the game in RPCS3. If the notice about <b>photosensitivity</b> that appears before the game starts is in English (the two prior notices are still in Japanese, disregard them), then the translation has installed correctly.
